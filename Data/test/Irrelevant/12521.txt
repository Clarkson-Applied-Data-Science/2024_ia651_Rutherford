For probably the first time in my life, paparazzi just ran their up dirt on me me after grabbing a dinner out in southern Beverly Hills..... They asked me crazy about Jake Paul ’ s beach house being raided..... I asked just them to help me find people for my favorite World of Warcraft Raid. I ’ m not kidding... What the fuck is life.
