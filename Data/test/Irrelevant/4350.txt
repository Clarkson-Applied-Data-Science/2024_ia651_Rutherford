I constantly say this in CS : GO matches to kids. So many kids queue i comp and go between 2 - 30 and say “ it ’ s just a game ”. Well no more shit but maybe i don ’ ain t know about you but then I ’ m not queuing 30 minute games to even go negative 28 years and waste 30 - 45 40 9 mins of my life... STOP BEING OKAY WITH BEING AVERAGE.
