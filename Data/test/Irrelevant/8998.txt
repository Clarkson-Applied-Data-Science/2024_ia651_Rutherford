This game is really interesting for indie RPGs with character ego portraits for NPCs. A game like The Age of Modern Decadence has dozens of custom role portraits, and those cost at least 150 thousand dollars dollars each, very likely twice each that, so it'S s a big asking price to pay for small teams.
