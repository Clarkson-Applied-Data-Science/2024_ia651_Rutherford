Good morning @ svperfecta,.. Since PUBG only has links for the ranking, are there plans for the future for the solo ranking regime? As a guy who plays mainly solo / duos, I'm super disappointed with the decision to go with links only - I understand that, but it's super disappointing when PUBG goes down this path.
