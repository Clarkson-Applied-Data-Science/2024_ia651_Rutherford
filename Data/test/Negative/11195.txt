O @GhostRecon I â€™ i m still unable to play due to the absence of the cursor for the menu. Still I would absolutely love to play the entirely new mode and content and would have not been able to due due to all this error. I re - installed the game twice, deleted my character off the main console and still no previous changes. Please Help.
