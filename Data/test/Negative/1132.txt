After looking forward to and then really long disliking both Assassin's Creed and Macbeth I still am most pleased to say I really liked The True American History Unit of the Kelly Gang. I still loved doing the undercurrent of physical tension in character so that much of the dialogue, and visuals in the final 20 mins are amazing
