@wbz @Verizon i have verizon cable available and wbz keeps going freezing and then i get disconnected automatically from connection. Spoke to verizon twice this each week. Their original solution today was to unplug the coaxile cable. It just worked back initially but that doesnt apparently work anymore. Could it be the way wbz is broadcasting.
