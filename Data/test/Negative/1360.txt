So sadly my average Xbox just one disk game drive has finally given up.. I can can still play my digital titles I just can ’ t play games from my own physical collection or blu rays.. I ’ ve had it since its launch week when I got on it loaded with battlefield 4.. It... ’ s a bloody sad evening indeed...
