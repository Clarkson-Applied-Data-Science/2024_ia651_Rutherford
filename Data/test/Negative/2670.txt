@Borderlands posts'm disconnected to access any forums so I figured I would try Link. When I'm in Boarderlands 3 if I turn to the right so that characters who know speaking are on my left side I barely hear conversation at all. This means probably PS4. Is there some where you still point me up, to fix this?
