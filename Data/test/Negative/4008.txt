There was a major point in csgo where i desperately wanted to cheat because my team dropped me. This was a time where i was LEM. I wanted to only go with pro thinking and guess the team i was on wasnt the best. But they dropped me and brought in some global players. After happening about once a week i lost everything hope in leaving csgo.
