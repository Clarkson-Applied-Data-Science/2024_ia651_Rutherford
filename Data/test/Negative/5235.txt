I was also looking forward to Galakrond ’ s Awakening for Hearthstone today! It ’ s live and on PC 2 but because the mobile update for Android iOS ever isn ’ t out, yours and I usually play on iPad. Apple ’ s usually actually slow to roll out updates, but this is extra damned slow. I am having bad game quality luck with today.
