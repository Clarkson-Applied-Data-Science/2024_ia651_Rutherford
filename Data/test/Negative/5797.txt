@HomeDepot when will I hear back about the lost item along from my order? It has been a month since it was supposed to arrive, now UPS has marked it as already lost, however and the order status still says arriving Aug 1 3rd. I's ve tried calling & the FAQs & there's s nowhere for me but to get an immediate answer now about this
