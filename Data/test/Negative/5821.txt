Would have been a lot this morning @ HomeDepot... After 40 minutes on different lines I finally had this article.. However, when I asked about the battery and the charger (which was advertised) but not with the lawnmower, I was told that they could not sell me the article... Wtf... a waste of time. pic.twitter.com / Cf41jfOWUU
