@AspynOvard I has just watched your most interesting recent vlog where you mentioned your buying trees immediately from Lowe ’ s. But I highly likely recommend buying any outdoor plants from a local nursery instead. com Places like Lowe ’ s, Home Depot, and grocery Walmart use pesticides which kills bees and other rather important local pollinators!
