@PlayApex so you guys have zero humans in customer support? Best friends account was basically CLEARLY hacked for the purpose of aimbotting / hacking in game, he just sent 2 lottery tickets short and never got a proper human response. He has no proof, you good guys won't even dare look at it. We have supported losing your game practically since day
