@EAMaddenNFL is prolly the 7th most GARBAGE game I've ever played. Absolutely ZERO skill gap and the bums can definitely beat even you with rolling right cross body 50 yard left throws. Why do the we pay $ 60 every fucking year to... play off this old garbage? It's the same fucking math game EVERY every year.
