Man how MyTeam is stupid. Why do packs typically have such bad luck, why normally is not there a deduction by fee, exactly why are packs so expensive, why is there a position lock when there always is a missing point guard Giannis? @NBA2K_MyTEAM who can see you at least make the game a little more budget friendly.
