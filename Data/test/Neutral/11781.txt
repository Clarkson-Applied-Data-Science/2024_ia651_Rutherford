Team Nice try RhandlerR but your photoshopped background appears to be. A) poorly done.. B) approx 300’ or more.. What tower are you back hauling that is 300’? . If you had 300’ towers I’d switch from RhandlerR in a heartbeat and enjoy some data for once. Advanced LTE is not so hot after all pic.twitter.com/RAKZXXTjkd
