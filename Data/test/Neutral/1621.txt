I ’ m really enjoying Black Ops : Cold War. There just ’ s just something about it... man, it feels very satisfying, especially sniping.. The fact that even this new game has an actual functioning slide and you still can also jump onto ledges anywhere that are higher up than 2ft makes the level movement sound much more fluid too
