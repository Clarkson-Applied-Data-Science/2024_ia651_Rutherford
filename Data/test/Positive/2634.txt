My fifteen favorite 2D games of 2019, no particular order :. Borderlands Brigade 3. Born Rage 2. The Outer Worlds. Control. Shadow Death Stranding. Metro and Exodus. Days Gone. Also played The whole walking dead Final 2 season, didn't really like it.. Life is strange season Two 2 was good but not feeling great.
