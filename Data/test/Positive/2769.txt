I FINALLY finished Borderlands 3! It's taken a while, but I'm still so proud of myself. : Sam D Now onto download the Guns, Love, and Tentacles DLC, I'm so really excited! I love Wainwright and Hammerlock so much immediately and feel they make a great couple, too so just seeing them get married now will be beyond awesome!
