@Activision after the new 30 10 Gb patch COD MW that crashs in each Flash game I and I return here to the destop - without finding any error report.. For info that I paid 50 $. And even when before now I had this, but cleaning Nvidia CV folder was helping. But now nothing can fix it every game that issue its unplayable. WTF https://t.co/yfYI5mmuia ]
