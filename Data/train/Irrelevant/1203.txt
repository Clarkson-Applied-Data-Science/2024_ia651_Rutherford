First Community ban dealing with 13 / 11 K / 6 D after killing someone via intentionally shooting at his exposed legs. I now wonder that me who struggled getting 1 + K / 24 D would certainly be suspected hacking, why that 30 / 0 K / 9 D guy was not the first one, or is this possibly the complement for my new skill?
