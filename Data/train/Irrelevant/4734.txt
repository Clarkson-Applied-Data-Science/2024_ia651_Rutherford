@MerlynJD Merlyn, See seriously that quirky trio? “ LOVE ’ S POST JOURNAL... TOO... And TOO MUCH. ” Rik Love writes his private diary and as did a series number of shorts after turning 80 — at post time. Rik, his kin and super friends are weird, also goofy, of totally odd characters. Google for and enjoy! Riklove. com https://t.co/hE3730tcmH ]
