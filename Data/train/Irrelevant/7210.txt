@riotgames @LeagueOfLegends whoever i should tag but can you actually get to banning actual toxic, frustrating, players? which is of it that too hard to actually do? you guys are a million dollar gaming company worldwide and all yet you cant manage you to do that something about. Hate the vile players that make this game unpleasant.
