5 @HP @HPSupport or @hplabs. x Bought HP Smart Pavilion Core i7, Gen, NVIDIA GEFORCE and everything... that's there... Can't tell you how much time I have wasted in waiting for it to load a Word Data File or a PPT... Higher order programs like Chrome 11 are an practically absolute modern nightmare... Why is it always loading?
