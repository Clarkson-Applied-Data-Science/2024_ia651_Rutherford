I sit there and realize how much we as a community have done in the last year.. We helped our rhinos realize their dream to play in the Overwatch League... I wear this shirt with pride and represent what we as a community and a country have done!.. And our boys have made us proud, I say! pic.facebook.com / KQAT55Cz8l
