Well last week pretty much sucked. Sick for two days, so then my already very reliable Motorola Force Z died on the Christmas Day. While Verizon store wouldn't t really let me replace it ( long no story ). So Had to bring order online, ordered overnight, but the system reset to 2 Day. This week so just far so good.
