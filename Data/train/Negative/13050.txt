Seen what some say : " Mad Dirt Racing 5, an Xbox Series 1 X game ( Multiplat but totally ok ) looks worse still than Forza Motorsport 4 on the 360! Why?! ".. TLOU2, a game made on a PlayStation 1. 8 terraflop system, arguably looks better than Super Spider - Man aka Miles Morales. Why?.. 2 Game design, exclusivity and budget MATTERS people. https://t.co/5x0QtMPKpB ]
