After learning what happened tonight with my Xbox kill scare yesterday, I also decided to take up my friends to advice and uninstalled Borderlands 3 since it ’ of s known to screw up Xbox ’ s. Which really sucks, I ’ don ll just have to wait and get it on PS4 since evidently there ’ s no issues with it just over there.
