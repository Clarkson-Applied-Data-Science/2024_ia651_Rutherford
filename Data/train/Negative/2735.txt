@Borderlands Can we please help fix the camera lag, audio issues, and crashes on PS4 after the update. It is VERY hard to play with 10 MP fps or slightly less. Don't always want this limited Cartel to run out and not quite be able fully to hold play properly. Also, MENUS! Please Fix the player MENU LAG! Please!
