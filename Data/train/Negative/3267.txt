And My son told me he just googled me. As in someone that doesn't have Facebook, nor Instagram or also a mug shot the only other thing he could find available was my first twitter download account from 2012. It has 3 posts online about the same baseball team and a picture of my dog. All the rest inside of you are screwed.
