Bought my own dining room table from @HomeDepot and it showed up to my house with only a huge crack in between the left corner of it. Still I ’ ve been on hold 2 different 3 times asking for over 8 30 minutes to speak to someone worried about it... I was so excited about this damn table and yet now I ’ m annoyed with it.
