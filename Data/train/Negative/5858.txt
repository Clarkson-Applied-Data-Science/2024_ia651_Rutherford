@HomeDepot I now have not received a refund for an appliance returned 4 / 1. Also I've hardly called customer service problems twice lately only to get stuck waiting for for 45 + 30 min or talking to a contractor who can't help me. I've also emailed but only recently got response saying the email by address wasn't monitored. Help!
