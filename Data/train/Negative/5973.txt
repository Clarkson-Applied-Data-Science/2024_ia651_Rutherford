@GovLauraKelly please mandate masks in all public ( except restaurants while seated ) and for all the employees especially of businesses otherwise open to public. Sadly one too many black Kansas residents and places people like @HomeDepot and especially @caseysgenstore don â€™ t care about other town people to go do the right thing on their own.
