Why thank the fuck everyone has when @EA made stamina on fifa 20 times so bad cant go 20 minutes out in game time with just a great side without all of the players stamina dropping so slow so fast. Wow Stupid idea to just bring that into a game experience where stamina development is vital. Seriously this needs to be sorted out asap.
