Got Pred! Flew through plt 2 to dim 1 then we hit a massive wall. Every game became a struggle, kept dying to bs, nothing was going our way, I wanted to give up. Sucked it up and grinded it. Took 6 hrs to get pred from d1, thats how bad our games were. @PlayApex @Dead_Toast_ pic.twitter.com/kzwVtvQ0wL
