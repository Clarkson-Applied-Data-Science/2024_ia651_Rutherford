@EAMaddenNFL... Why games don ’ t let you create a clear inactivity and feature online play that concedes games after two delays of game by the guy you ’ re playing to when you ’ re beating them senseless. Nobody waits 25 min longer to get 50 Xp points for a win when the direct loser is taking penalties straight back to their goal line
