Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020... is yet another heavy reminder that the download - only future of gaming is not necessarily quite a good known thing. Reports of a 90GB download date before you can even get start the first game - despite pre - loading it - are infuriating. Very much sorry also for Australian Macintosh gamers.
