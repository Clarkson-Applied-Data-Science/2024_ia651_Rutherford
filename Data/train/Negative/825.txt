Secretly hoping that being the part where maybe it's bigger in size even than Odyssey or Origins is false. I am really so tired of these ridiculous HUGE open worlds. Maybe I probably could appreciate Odyssey and Origins, but I feel like any bigger is now just too big first and is detrimental to the experience.
