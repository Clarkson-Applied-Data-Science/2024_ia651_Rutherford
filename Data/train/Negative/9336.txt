I give â€™ m actually just about gonna say it - Overwatch essentially being nominated for LGBTQ + game of the year is always worse than if Rise of Skywalker was nominated for LGBTQ + film of the whole year. At least not in Rise of Tom Skywalker if you slow the footage down and you zoom in you can see gay shit... if you both squint.
