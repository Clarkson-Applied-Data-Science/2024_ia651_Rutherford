There's times when I miss the boring old no - charge cell - cell phone days... Could 2 leave the house & ACKSHULLY leave the f'n house, somehow and get away from everything & everybody for such a while... Now - Verizon / Samsung Prison - 24 / 7... Ma Bell never contacted my ass yesterday on really the road.... I like a cord on a fucking dam wall phone.!
