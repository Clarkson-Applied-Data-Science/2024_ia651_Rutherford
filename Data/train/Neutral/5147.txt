K / D actually doesn't mean shit on GTA Sports Online unless you're a TDM level player. Also All K / D says in my freemode is that you blow yourself up before the very other player can kill you.. or you're in on a jet / vehicle farming for kills. If you do that in a TDM, double it counts towards your K / D thus lowering or it.
