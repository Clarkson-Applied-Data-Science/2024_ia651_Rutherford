4 Saw a huge fist fight in a Home Depot parking lot. My 1st Sickening thought was to get my own phone and record. I stopped myself and said No I'U m totally not doing that. Why are we always so quick then to record to someone's heart pain tears and humiliation for entertainment? Why does this bring us joy?
