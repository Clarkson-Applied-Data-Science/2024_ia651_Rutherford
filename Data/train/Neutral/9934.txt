I said I wouldn ’ t get a ps5 but fucking hell GT7 seems like its original GT4 : 2 ( which is a good thing, a really good thing ), and the new Spider - Am Man looks like nothing it ’ ll be pretty extremely good, growl and ratchet & roar clank ’ s trailer looked amazing as with all the good stuff they had onscreen. Fucking no hell shit thats tough
