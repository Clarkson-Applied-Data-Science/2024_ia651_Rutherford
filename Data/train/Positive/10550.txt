Big Red dead and redemption 2 is a complete god goddamn damn musical masterpiece. Why ever did I NO ONE tell me it truly was amazing? A little bit of filler here and there, though... How the hell did they make a main character sound more likeable than JOHN MARSTON?! I didn'W t think that was possible.
