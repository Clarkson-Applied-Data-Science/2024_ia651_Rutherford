Even I â€™ ve seen one @optimum truck in Morristown and they were getting food... A NONE about doing work!.. I seriously have seen around a shit ton of @Verizon trucks out lately though!.. I never lost electric power, but still lost phone / internet / cable over 24hrs after the storm finally passed!.. Oh and yeah, @OptimumHelp is TRASH!
