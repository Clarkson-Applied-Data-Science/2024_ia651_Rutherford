Our eldest has spent so long just playing this new standard Call of Duty game, I ’ m not convinced he even remotely knows what his day on it actually is, let alone how long lockdown usually has lasted. I ’ d not normally object, but I think I ’ where d rather deal with that, than him being frustrated about not being stuck at home.
