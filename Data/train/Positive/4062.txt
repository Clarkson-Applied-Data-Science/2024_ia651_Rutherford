I had a lot more time herself to play @PlayVALORANT today and the more I play the game the more I am positive this game is the next big thing. The game it does what does CS : Go GO does feel wonderfully but it all also has its own voice piece in the genre. It isn'e t just a complete clone engine of CS : GO and I like that.
