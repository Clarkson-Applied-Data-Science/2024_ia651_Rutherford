A quick tale. PS3 was too expensive at launch so I waited. After a couple of years, Sony found ways to bring the retail price down & I got my PS3 in an amazing offer. Amazon bundle included 2 Blurays and 1 game for $352.95. Then my new Sony credit card gave $100 statement credit! pic.twitter.com/oRTmBNP6Nn
