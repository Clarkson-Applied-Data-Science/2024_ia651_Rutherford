Google Maps is interesting and nostalgic. . I was checking out an area I frequently went to with my parents as a child. We usually went into that Rite Aid for ice cream, but as you can see, it's now closed. It's bittersweet but I'm kinda happy I can see it in it's former glory pic.twitter.com/gHSwpvHJaO
