CS The dream is to fill a lobby in GTA IV Online, last night we reached 15 players and it was awesome. . . We've been logging on about 7pm UK time, if you want to play with us then add me on GFWL as "MrRobert9202". You should also join my discord for notifications when we're playing. pic.twitter.com/LgNJLqB1sT
