Designing @PlayHearthstone code team : Now I really like the Spellburst II mechanic. Because It " really forces " me to take more time at the near start of my turn and to plan according to what I want to achieve = it also helps me and be a better player. Thanks! @Celestalon updates @IksarHS with @Songbird_HS
