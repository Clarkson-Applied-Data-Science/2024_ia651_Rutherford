Buying Microsoft / Xbox Zenimax / Bethesda is huge.. I wish I was awake for it all to go down.. But... I don't know how I feel about it... On the one hand: I honestly don't care about Beth games.. But I know people who love them and primarily play on PlayStation, so that could potentially suck for them.
