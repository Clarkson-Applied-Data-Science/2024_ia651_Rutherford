Happy 10th anniversary to Fallout: New Vegas!. . The best entry of the Bethesda Fallout titles. I loved the characters and deep rpg options. I'm so excited that Microsoft now owns both Bethesda and Obsidian.. Hopefully we can get a remaster.. . "The Game was Rigged From the Start!" pic.twitter.com/rC5QegiQaD
