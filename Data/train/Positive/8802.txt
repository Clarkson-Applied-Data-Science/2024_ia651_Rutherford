2013 So do my new comp has an AMD 5700 V8 xt Red Dragon anyone have exp with ANY about AMD cards? It seems like the drivers are very buggy, which only I know, but new drivers were supposed now to be better but my comp is still having GPU related crashes. Should you just return it for from an Advanced NVidia 2070 V8 super?
