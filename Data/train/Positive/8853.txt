Exciting news!! I'm finally upgrading my gaming PC. Intel Coreâ„¢ i9-9900KF, ASUS Prime Z390-A, 32 Gigs of G.Skill TridentZ DDR4 4266 on the way! Will take over a month to get everything in, but I'm really hyped. Eyeballing those 30 series Nvidia cards, VR, and new monitors too! https://t.co/OFtI1W1KyS
