I also know this is a sick joke but this actually makes up me so sad, I love this game so much ( despite it being torture sometimes ) & seeing it fall farther apart thinking like this is heart breaking. For reasons so long, everyone always joked that after the game was dying ( probably since like early 2018 in at least ) and now it really is.
